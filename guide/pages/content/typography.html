      <h1>Typography</h1>

      <p>The Star Tribune uses specific typography. Typography can change based on the type on content it is; we refer to these as <strong><a href="#contexts">context</a></strong>. There are also many variables and functions that can be used to refer to certain <a href="#fonts">fonts</a>, styles, or contexts.</p>

<p><em>Note that most of the font types are owned by WebType and cannot be reused without permission and are here for internal ease of use only.</em></p>

<h2 id="contexts">Contexts</h2>

<p><strong>Contexts</strong> define some high level properties, a bit like switching the theme but less heavy-handed. Overall, we use context to change the default typography. You should change the context with a class, most likely, at the root of your project, such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;body class="feature"&gt;</code>.</p>

<h3 id="news">News</h3>

<p>The default, assumed context is <em>news</em>; you can use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.context-news</code> class to switch to this context explicitly if you like.</p>

<p>This guide is in the <em>news</em> context and all the typography described above is that context, so there’s no need to repeat here.</p>

<h3 id="feature">Feature</h3>

<p>For features or “soft news” context, use the <code class="highlighter-rouge">.context-feature</code> context.</p>

<div class="alert alert-warning"><span class="sr-only">Warning: </span>This section needs some serious work.</div>
